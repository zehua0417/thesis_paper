	abstract = {Endothelial cells are located at the critical interface between circulating blood and semi-solid tissues and have many important roles in maintaining systemic physiological function. The vascular endothelium is particularly susceptible to pathogenic stimuli that activate tumour suppressor pathways leading to cellular senescence. In the past few years, the literature on cellular senescence has expanded and we now understand that senescent endothelial cells are highly active, secretory and pro-inflammatory, and exhibit an aberrant morphological phenotype. Moreover, endothelial senescence has been identified as an important contributor to various cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. In this Review, we discuss the consequences of endothelial cell exposure to damaging stimuli (haemodynamic forces, circulating and endothelial derived factors) and the cellular and molecular mechanisms that induce endothelial cell senescence. We also discuss how endothelial cell senescence causes arterial dysfunction and contributes to clinical cardiovascular diseases and metabolic disorders. Finally, we summarize the latest evidence on the impact of eliminating senescent endothelial cells (senolysis), and identify important remaining questions that can be addressed in future studies.},

However, it is debated whether E-cadherin functions instructively as a spatial cue, or permissively by ensuring adequate adhesion so that cells can sense other contact signals. In C. elegans, contacts polarize early embryonic cells by recruiting the RhoGAP PAC-1 to the adjacent cortex, inducing PAR protein asymmetry. Here we show that HMR-1/E-cadherin, which is dispensable for adhesion, functions together with HMP-1/α-catenin, JAC-1/p120 catenin, and the previously uncharacterized linker PICC-1/CCDC85/DIPA to bind PAC-1 and recruit it to contacts. Mislocalizing the HMR-1 intracellular domain to contact-free surfaces draws PAC-1 to these sites and depolarizes cells, demonstrating an instructive role for HMR-1 in polarization. Our findings identify an E-cadherin-mediated pathway that translates cell contacts into cortical polarity by directly recruiting a symmetry-breaking factor to the adjacent cortex.},

This review presents the current findings on chronological aging and photoaging in C. elegans, exploring the elaborate molecular pathways that control these processes. The progression of chronological aging is characterized by a gradual deterioration of physiological functions and is influenced by an interaction of genetic and environmental factors, including the insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) pathway. In contrast, photoaging is characterized by increased oxidative stress, DNA damage, and activation of stress response pathways induced by UV exposure. Although the genetic mechanisms of chronological aging in C. elegans have been characterized by extensive research, the pathways regulating photoaging are comparatively less well-studied. Here, we provide an overview of the current understanding of aging research, including the crucial genes and genetic pathways involved in the aging and photoaging processes of C. elegans. Understanding the complex interactions between these factors will provide invaluable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying chronological aging and photoaging and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches and further studies for promoting healthy aging in humans.},

	abstract = {Research on the skin is continuously evolving, and it is imperative to select a streamlined and efficient research model. Caenorhabditis elegans is a free-leaving nematode whose epidermis serves as the primary barrier epithelium, composed of a collagen matrix. Differentiation of the epidermis begins in the middle of embryonic development, including polarization of the cytoskeleton and formation of cell junctions. Cuticle secretion is one of the main developmental and physiological features of the epidermis. Mutations in the collagen genes of individual worms lead to cuticle defects, thereby changing the shape of the animals. The complete genome sequence of C. elegans indicates that more than 170 different collagen genes may be related to this structure. Collagen is a structural protein that plays an important role in the development of extracellular matrix. Different collagen genes are expressed at different stages of matrix synthesis, which may help form specific interactions between different collagens. The differentiated epidermis also plays a key role in the transmission of hormonal signals, fat storage, and ion homeostasis and is closely related to the development and function of the nervous system. The epidermis also provides passive and active defenses against pathogens that penetrate the skin and can repair wounds. In addition, age-dependent epidermal degeneration is a prominent feature of aging and may affect aging and lifespan. This review we highlight recent findings of the structure and related physiological functions of the cuticle of C. elegans. In contrast to previous studies, we offer novel insights into the utilization of C. elegans as valuable models for skin-related investigations. It also encourages the use of C. elegans as a skin model, and its high-throughput screening properties facilitate the acceleration of fundamental research in skin-related diseases.},

Using the C. elegans intestinal epithelium, we identiﬁed a patterning mechanism that is informed by cell contact lifetime asymmetry and executed via the scaffolding protein PAR-3 and the transmembrane protein E-cadherin/HMR-1. Intestinal cells break symmetry as PAR-3 and HMR-1 recruit apical determinants into punctate ‘‘local polarity complexes’’ (LPCs) at homotypic contacts. LPCs undergo an HMR-1-based migration to a common midline, thereby establishing tissue-wide polarity. Thus, symmetry breaking results from PAR-3-dependent intracellular polarization coupled to HMR1-based tissue-level communication, which occurs through a non-adhesive signaling role for HMR-1. Differential lifetimes between homotypic and heterotypic cell contacts are created by neighbor exchanges and oriented divisions, patterning where LPCs perdure and thereby breaking symmetry. These cues offer a logical and likely conserved framework for how epithelia without obvious molecular asymmetries can polarize.},

Here, we used a C. elegans epidermis model in which skinpenetrating infection or injury activates immune defense and antimicrobial peptide (AMP) production. By systemically disrupting each architectural component, we found that only disturbance of the apical hemidesmosomes triggered an immune response and robust AMP expression. The epidermis recognized structural damage through hemidesmosomes associated with a STAT-like protein, whose disruption led to detachment of STA-2 molecules from hemidesmosomes and transcription of AMPs. This machinery enabled the epidermis to bypass certain signaling ampliﬁcation and directly trigger AMP production when subjected to extensive architectural damage. Together, our ﬁndings uncover an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the epithelial barriers to detect danger and activate immune defense.},

	abstract = {We show that a single clinical isolate of the human opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa (strain PA14), which previously was shown to be pathogenic in mice and plants, also kills Caenorhabditis elegans. The rate of PA14-mediated killing of C. elegans depends on the composition of the agar medium on which PA14 is grown. When PA14 is grown on minimal medium, killing occurs over the course of several days and is referred to as ‘‘slow’’ killing. When PA14 is grown on high-osmolarity medium, killing occurs over the course of several hours and is referred to as ‘‘fast’’ killing. Several lines of evidence, including the fact that heat-killed bacteria are still capable of fast but not slow killing of C. elegans, indicate that fast and slow killing occur by distinct mechanisms. Slow killing involves an infection-like process and correlates with the accumulation of PA14 within worm intestines. Among 10 PA14 virulence-related mutants that had been shown previously to affect pathogenicity in plants and mice, 6 were less effective in killing C. elegans under both fastand slow-killing conditions, indicating a high degree of commonalty among the P. aeruginosa factors required for pathogenicity in disparate eukaryotic hosts. Thus, we show that a C. elegans pathogenicity model that is genetically tractable from the perspectives of both host and pathogen can be used to model mammalian bacterial pathogenesis.},

Their expression, activity, and subcellular localization are associated with the distinct development and differentiation stages of immune cells. They promote the activation of innate myeloid immune cells since they contribute to toll-like receptor signaling and to cytokine secretion. Furthermore, they control lysosomal biogenesis and autophagic ﬂux, thus affecting innate immune cell survival and polarization. They also regulate bidirectional communication between the cell exterior and the cytoskeleton, thus inﬂuencing cell interactions, morphology, and motility. Importantly, cysteine cathepsins contribute to the priming of adaptive immune cells by controlling antigen presentation and are involved in cytotoxic granule mediated killing in cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells. Cathepins’aberrant activity can be prevented by their endogenous inhibitors, cystatins. However, dysregulated proteolysis contributes signiﬁcantly to tumor progression also by modulation of the antitumor immune response. Especially tumor-associated myeloid cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which are known for their tumor promoting and immunosuppressive functions, constitute the major source of excessive cysteine cathepsin activity in cancer. Since they are enriched in the tumor microenvironment, cysteine cathepsins represent exciting targets for development of new diagnostic and therapeutic moieties.},

              Dysfunctional extracellular matrices (ECM) contribute to aging and disease. Repairing dysfunctional ECM could potentially prevent age-related pathologies. Interventions promoting longevity also impact ECM gene expression. However, the role of ECM composition changes in healthy aging remains unclear.

              C. elegans
              revealing three distinct collagen dynamics. Longevity interventions slow age-related collagen stiffening and prolong the expression of collagens that are turned over. These prolonged collagen dynamics are mediated by a mechanical feedback loop of hemidesmosome-containing structures that span from the exoskeletal ECM through the hypodermis, basement membrane ECM, to the muscles, coupling mechanical forces to adjust ECM gene expression and longevity via the transcriptional co-activator YAP-1 across tissues. Our results provide in-vivo evidence that coordinated ECM remodeling through mechanotransduction is required and sufficient to promote longevity, offering potential avenues for interventions targeting ECM dynamics.},

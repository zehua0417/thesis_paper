  abstract = {Single-cell transcriptome measurements can reveal unexplored
              biological diversity, but they suffer from technical noise and bias
              that must be modeled to account for the resulting uncertainty in
              downstream analyses. Here we introduce single-cell variational
              inference (scVI), a ready-to-use scalable framework for the
              probabilistic representation and analysis of gene expression in
              single cells (https://github.com/YosefLab/scVI). scVI uses
              stochastic optimization and deep neural networks to aggregate
              information across similar cells and genes and to approximate the
              distributions that underlie observed expression values, while
              accounting for batch effects and limited sensitivity. We used scVI
              for a range of fundamental analysis tasks including batch
              correction, visualization, clustering, and differential expression,
              and achieved high accuracy for each task.},
